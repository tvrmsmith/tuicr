> Pronounced "tweaker".

## What it does

- GitHub-style continuous diff in the terminal. Scroll through every changed file in one stream.
- PR-style comments at the line, range, file, and review level. 
- Review tracking at file or hunk granularity, persisted across sessions.
- Three export targets: push a real review to GitHub, GitLab, Gitea, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, or Gerrit, copy
  structured markdown to your clipboard, or pipe to stdout.
- Works with git, jj, and mercurial. Reviews uncommitted changes, commit ranges, or any GitHub PR,
  GitLab MR, Gitea PR, Bitbucket PR, Azure DevOps PR, or Gerrit change.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL tuicr.dev/install.sh | sh
# or
brew install tuicr
# or
sudo pacman -S tuicr
```

<details>
<summary>Other install methods (cargo, mise, nix, binaries, source)</summary>

```bash
# Cargo
cargo install tuicr

# Mise
mise use github:agavra/tuicr

# Nix
nix run github:agavra/tuicr
```

Pre-built binaries: [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/agavra/tuicr/releases). Linux releases
include dynamically linked GNU and static musl variants.

From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agavra/tuicr.git
cd tuicr
cargo install --path .
```

</details>

Update the active installation with one command:

```bash
tuicr update
tuicr update 0.18.0 # Install a known-good version
```

`tuicr update` uses Homebrew, Cargo, Mise, or a Nix profile when that manager owns the
executable. Install-script and manually downloaded binaries update in place from the matching
GitHub release asset after SHA-256 verification. Exact-version installs support Cargo and direct
binaries; use the package manager's pinning workflow for Homebrew, Mise, or Nix. A `nix run`
invocation is temporary rather than installed; rerun it to use the current flake, or use
`nix profile install github:agavra/tuicr` for an installation that `tuicr update` can upgrade.

## Quick start

```bash
tuicr                       # Pick from a commit selector
tuicr tui                   # Same TUI, explicit subcommand
tuicr -w                    # Uncommitted changes (skip selector)
tuicr -r main..HEAD         # Commit range
tuicr pr 125                # GitHub, Gitea, Bitbucket, or Azure DevOps PR, or Gerrit change
tuicr pr 125 --remote up    # Use a named Git remote's fetch URL
tuicr mr 125                # GitLab MR
tuicr tui pr 125            # GitHub PR via explicit TUI subcommand
tuicr tui mr 125            # GitLab MR via explicit TUI subcommand
tuicr --stdout              # Pipe the review to stdout
tuicr --no-grouping         # Plain directory tree instead of the grouped sidebar
tuicr review list           # List saved local review sessions
tuicr update                # Update the active installation
tuicr update 0.18.0         # Install a known-good version
```

Every flag, environment variable, and exit code in [docs/CLI.md](docs/CLI.md).

Inside tuicr, navigate with `j`/`k`, press `c` to comment, then `y` to copy the review or
`:submit` to push it to GitHub, GitLab, Gitea, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, or Gerrit. When reopening a
pull request you've reviewed before, tuicr preselects commits newer than your latest submitted
review when that metadata is available; commits already covered by that review are marked with
`✓` in the inline selector.
(Bitbucket does not record which commit an approval covered, so that preselection does not apply
there.)
Use `:summary` during a review to show every pending local-draft comment. The summary replaces the
diff while leaving the file sidebar visible when it is open. The first
comment is selected when the view opens; use `j`/`k` to select the next or previous comment, and
the view scrolls automatically to keep it visible. Press `Enter` to jump to the selected comment
in the continuous diff, leaving single-file view if necessary, or `Esc` to return to the diff. If
its file or hunk is already marked reviewed, tuicr reveals the target without clearing that
reviewed state.
Auto-detects git, jj, or mercurial. SHA-256 Git repositories automatically use the Git CLI backend,
including when reviewing root commits; ordinary SHA-1 repositories still default to libgit2.

The file sidebar groups the changeset by concern instead of by directory: one collapsible
row per group, its files listed beneath it by full relative path. Collapse the groups and a
large review reads as a short overview of what changed. `--no-grouping` reviews the plain
directory tree instead, whose layout the `file_tree` config key controls.

The sidebar header says how the grouping stands: `· refining` while a `:regroup` is running,
`· heuristics only` or `· refine cancelled` when `[grouping].refine` produced nothing, and
`· 9% new · :regroup` once files have been placed into the grouping since the last full pass.
Those files' groups carry a `~` before their name. Let that number reach
`[grouping].regroup_threshold` (75% by default) and tuicr regroups the review itself, from
the heuristics alone — instant, offline, and never a model call.

¹ Lumen has `j`/`k` navigation but no broader vim model (visual mode, `{N}G`, `Ctrl-d`/`Ctrl-u`,
etc.).

² `gh pr review` posts approve/comment/request-changes at the review level only. No inline line
comments.

## Export your review

When you're done reviewing, send your comments wherever the work continues.

### To GitHub

`:submit` opens a picker for Comment, Approve, Request changes, or Draft. Inline comments land
on the right lines as a real PR review. Review-level comments become the review summary.
Requires `gh` authenticated to the repo.

### To GitLab

`:submit` offers Comment, Approve, Request changes, or Draft on a GitLab MR. Inline comments post
as discussion notes, or as draft notes for Draft. Review-level comments become the summary.
Requires `glab` authenticated to the host. Request changes needs your account to be an assigned
reviewer. See [docs/GITLAB.md](docs/GITLAB.md) for setup, self-hosted instances, and
troubleshooting.

### To Gitea

`:submit` offers Comment, Approve, Request changes, or Draft on a Gitea pull request. Inline
comments post as review comments and review-level comments become the summary, all in one request.
Requires [`tea`](https://gitea.com/gitea/tea) with a login for the instance (`tea logins add`).
Multi-line comments collapse to their last line — Gitea has no range form. See
[docs/GITEA.md](docs/GITEA.md) for setup, self-hosted detection, and limitations.

### To Bitbucket

`:submit` offers Comment or Approve on a Bitbucket Cloud PR. Inline comments post as inline PR
comments, multi-line ranges included; review-level comments become general PR comments. Requires
`bkt` authenticated to `bitbucket.org`. Request changes and Draft are not supported yet, and
Bitbucket Data Center is out of scope. See [docs/BITBUCKET.md](docs/BITBUCKET.md) for setup,
required token scopes, and troubleshooting.

### To Azure DevOps

`:submit` offers Comment, Approve, or Request changes on an Azure DevOps PR. Inline comments post
as PR comment threads; Approve/Request changes also cast a reviewer vote. Auth is a Personal
Access Token in `AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT` (preferred — works with enterprise tenants), falling back
to `az login` via the Azure CLI. Run tuicr from a local clone of the repo — Azure exposes no
unified-diff API, so the diff is built with `git diff base...head`. See
[docs/AZURE.md](docs/AZURE.md) for setup, supported URL forms, and MVP limitations.

### To Gerrit

`:submit` offers Comment, Approve, Request changes, or Draft on a Gerrit change. Inline comments
post as Gerrit comments (multi-line ranges included) and the review-level comment becomes the
change message; Approve votes `Code-Review +2` and Request changes votes `-1`. Draft keeps
everything as Gerrit draft comments so you can publish from the web UI. Auth is your Gerrit HTTP
password in `GERRIT_USERNAME` / `GERRIT_PASSWORD`. Run tuicr from a local clone — the diff is
built with `git diff base..head` after fetching the change's patch-set ref. See
[docs/GERRIT.md](docs/GERRIT.md) for setup, detection of self-hosted hosts, and limitations.

### To your coding agent

`y` or `:clip` copies a structured markdown block to your clipboard. Each comment has a number
and a file/line anchor: 

```markdown
I reviewed your code and have the following comments. Please address them.

1. `src/auth.rs` - Consider adding unit tests
2. `src/auth.rs:42` - Magic number should be a named constant
3. `src/auth.rs:50-55` - This block could be refactored
```

Paste it back to any coding agent (Claude, Codex, Cursor, etc).

For an agent-driven workflow where your agent opens tuicr in a cmux, tmux, Zellij, Herdr,
or Orca split pane, see [skills/tuicr/SKILL.md](skills/tuicr/SKILL.md).

### To stdout

Run with `--stdout` to pipe the markdown to another process:

```bash
tuicr --stdout > review.md
tuicr --stdout | pbcopy
```

## Review session CLI

`tuicr review` exposes saved sessions without opening the TUI. It can list
sessions, add comments, and print stored comments for agent and script
integrations. See [docs/REVIEW_CLI.md](docs/REVIEW_CLI.md).

The TUI creates a persisted session file when a review target becomes active,
so collaborative tools can add comments immediately. Empty auto-created session
files are removed when the TUI exits. `tuicr review list` marks currently open
TUI sessions with `"active": true`, proven by the recorded pid, and points an
idle session at the live one reviewing the same checkout with `superseded_by`.

Comments reach the session file the moment you confirm them, but `:send` is
what tells a polling agent the batch is ready: it bumps a monotonic
`release_count` on the session and stamps each comment with the batch it went
out in. `tuicr review list` reports `release_count`, `released_at`, and
`unreleased_count`; `tuicr review comments` reports `released_in` per comment.
`:w` stays a plain, idempotent save.

Inside the TUI, the review target selector's **Sessions** tab lists the saved
reviews for the current checkout, so you can resume one by picking it instead of
retyping the commit range it was opened with. Open it with `:sessions` or cycle
to it with `Tab`.

Every comment carries the `author` that wrote it, and `tuicr review add
--reply-to <comment-id>` records an answer to a specific comment, anchored at
that comment's file and line. Both fields are emitted by `tuicr review
comments`, so an agent polling a session can tell the human's feedback from its
own replies and see which comments it has already answered.

## Library API

tuicr also exposes a Rust library API for tools that want to build on top of its
persisted review sessions. `ReviewStore` can list sessions for a checkout, load a
session, and add review, file, line, or range comments using the same insertion
primitive as the TUI.

```rust
use tuicr::{AddCommentRequest, CommentTarget, CommentType, LineSide, ReviewStore};

let store = ReviewStore::new();
let sessions = store.list_sessions_for_repo("/path/to/repo")?;
let session = &sessions[0].session_ref;

store.add_comment(
    session,
    AddCommentRequest {
        target: CommentTarget::Line {
            path: "src/main.rs".into(),
            line: 42,
            side: LineSide::New,
        },
        content: "Handle the empty case here.".into(),
        comment_type: CommentType::from_id("issue"),
    },
)?;
```

## Configuration

Path: `~/.config/tuicr/config.toml` on Linux/macOS, `%APPDATA%\tuicr\config.toml` on Windows.

```toml
theme = "catppuccin-mocha"
diff_view = "side-by-side"   # or "unified"
ignore_whitespace = false    # ignore all whitespace in local VCS diffs
appearance = "system"        # or "dark" / "light"
mouse = true
leader = ";"                  # configurable prefix for leader shortcuts
editor = "nvim"               # editor for `e` / `:edit`; overrides $EDITOR
comment_vim = false           # vim modal editing in the review comment box
relative_line_numbers = false # show rendered-row distances in the diff gutter

[[comment_types]]
id = "issue"
color = "red"
definition = "must fix before merge"
```

Bundled themes: `dark`, `light`, `ayu-light`, `ayu-mirage`, `onedark`, `github-light`,
`github-dark`, `catppuccin-latte`, `catppuccin-frappe`, `catppuccin-macchiato`,
`catppuccin-mocha`, `everforest-dark`, `everforest-light`, `gruvbox-dark`,
`gruvbox-light`, `nord-dark`, `nord-light`, `nord-dark-high-contrast`,
`nord-light-high-contrast`, `solarized-light`, `solarized-dark`, `tokyo-night-storm`,
`tokyo-night-day`.

Local themes: set `theme = "my-theme"` or run `tuicr --theme my-theme`, then create
`~/.config/tuicr/themes/my-theme.toml` on Linux/macOS or `%APPDATA%\tuicr\themes\my-theme.toml`
on Windows. Local themes may reference a local `syntax_theme = "my-syntax.tmTheme"` file for
syntax highlighting. A ready-to-copy example lives at [`examples/tuicr-teal.toml`](examples/tuicr-teal.toml)
with its matching [`examples/tuicr-teal-syntax.tmTheme`](examples/tuicr-teal-syntax.tmTheme) syntax theme.

Full options, theme resolution precedence, `comment_types` semantics, and `.tuicrignore` rules in
[docs/CONFIG.md](docs/CONFIG.md).
