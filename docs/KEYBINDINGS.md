# Keybindings

Full reference. Press `?` inside tuicr for an in-app version of this list.

`<leader>` defaults to `;`. Override it with `leader = ","` in `~/.config/tuicr/config.toml`.

## Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `↓` | Scroll down |
| `k` / `↑` | Scroll up |
| `h` / `←` | Scroll left |
| `l` / `→` | Scroll right |
| `Ctrl-d` / `Ctrl-u` | Half page down / up |
| `Ctrl-f` / `Ctrl-b` | Full page down / up |
| `g` / `G` | Go to first / last file |
| `{N}G` | Go to source line N in current file |
| `{N}{motion}` | Vim-style count prefix — repeats `j` / `k` / `h` / `l` / `{` / `}` / `[` / `]` `N` times |
| `{` / `}` | Jump to previous / next file |
| `[` / `]` | Jump to previous / next hunk |
| `m` / `M` | Jump to next / previous comment |
| `/` | Search within diff (case-insensitive); matches on diff content are highlighted and the status bar shows the `[current/total]` position (headers, comments, and PR info are searchable but not highlighted) |
| `n` / `N` | Next / previous search match (wraps around) |
| `Esc` | Clear search-match highlighting; the pattern is kept so `n` / `N` still work |
| `Enter` | Expand or collapse hidden context between hunks |
| `zt` | Scroll cursor to top of screen |
| `zz` | Center cursor on screen |
| `zb` | Scroll cursor to bottom of screen |

## Help

Press `?` to open help.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `/` | Search within help (case-insensitive) |
| `n` / `N` | Next / previous help search match |
| `j` / `k` | Scroll down / up |
| `q` / `?` / `Esc` | Close help |

## File tree

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` | Toggle expand directory (group row while grouping is on) |
| `Enter` | Expand directory or group / jump to file in diff |
| `o` | Expand all directories or groups |
| `O` | Collapse all directories or groups |
| `i` | Filter to files matching a regex (include) |
| `e` | Filter out files matching a regex (exclude) |
| `I` | Clear the include filter |
| `E` | Clear the exclude filter |
| `/` | Search file paths (substring) |
| `n` / `N` | Next / previous file-path match |

These keys are only active while the file tree is focused — in the diff, `i` still
edits the comment at the cursor and `/` still searches the diff.

### Filtering

`i` and `e` take case-insensitive regexes matched against each file's **full
relative path** (`^src/`, `\.rs$`, `test|spec`). Both can be active at once:
include runs first, then exclude removes from what's left.

A filter is not just a tree view — hidden files also disappear from the diff
pane, from `{`/`}` file navigation, `[`/`]` hunk navigation, and from the file
and `+/-` counts in the header. The tree title reports how much is hidden
(`Files · 2/12 · 12 of 58`), and the active patterns show in its bottom border.

Enter applies, `Esc` cancels, `Ctrl-u` clears the line. Reopening a prompt
pre-fills the pattern already applied, so submitting an emptied buffer is the
same as `I` / `E`. An invalid regex reports the error and leaves the prompt open
so it can be fixed. Comments on hidden files are not deleted and still export —
filters are a view, not an edit.

Filters are session-local: they are not written to the review session and reset
when tuicr restarts, but they survive a `:e` reload.

### Search

`/` moves only the tree selection to the next matching path, expanding collapsed
parents as needed, and leaves the diff viewport where it was — press `Enter` to
jump the diff there. `n` / `N` step matches and wrap around. Search only ever
considers files that pass the active filters.

## Panel focus

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` / `Shift-Tab` | Cycle focus forward / backward between file list, comment navigator, diff, and commit selector |
| `<leader>h` | Focus file list (left panel) |
| `<leader>l` | Focus diff view (right panel) |
| `<leader>k` | Move focus up (comments to files, or diff/files to commit selector when visible) |
| `<leader>j` | Move focus down (files to comments when visible, otherwise diff) |
| `<leader>e` | Toggle file list visibility |
| `<leader>s` | Toggle commit selector visibility (also `:set commits!`) |
| `<leader>g` | Toggle grouped sidebar / directory tree (also `:set groups!`) |
| `Enter` | Select file (when file list is focused) |

## Comment navigator

Shown below the file tree when local comments or visible remote PR threads exist.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `k` | Move selection |
| `h` / `l` | Scroll rows left / right |
| `Enter` | Jump to selected comment |

## Review actions

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `r` | Toggle file reviewed |
| `R` | Toggle hunk reviewed |
| `x` | Toggle a grouping mark on the group or file under the cursor |
| `c` | Add line comment (or file comment if not on a diff line) |
| `C` | Add file comment |
| `<leader>c` | Add review comment |
| `v` / `V` | Enter visual mode for range comments |
| `dd` | Delete comment at cursor |
| `i` | Edit comment at cursor (vim: text cursor at start) |
| `A` | Edit comment at cursor with text cursor at end (vim mode only) |
| `e` | Open focused file in `$EDITOR` |
| `y` | Copy review to clipboard |
| `Y` | Copy the comment at cursor to clipboard |

`e` opens the file at the cursor's line. Terminal editors (`vim`, `nvim`, `nano`, …)
take over the screen and tuicr reloads the diff once they exit. Windowed editors
(`code`, `cursor`, `zed`, `subl`, …) open in their own window while tuicr stays on
screen; reload with `:e` after editing. Adding `--wait` to `$EDITOR` opts a windowed
editor back into the blocking behaviour.

## Visual mode

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `k` | Extend selection down / up |
| `c` / `Enter` | Create comment for selected range |
| `Esc` / `v` / `V` | Cancel selection |

## Comment mode

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` / `Shift-Tab` | Cycle comment type forward / backward (per `comment_types` order) |
| `Enter` / `Ctrl-Enter` / `Ctrl-s` | Save comment |
| `Shift-Enter` / `Ctrl-j` | Insert newline |
| `←` / `→` | Move cursor |
| `Ctrl-w` / `Alt-Backspace` / `Cmd-Backspace` | Delete word |
| `Ctrl-u` | Clear line |
| `Esc` / `Ctrl-c` | Cancel |

With `comment_vim = true` the box uses [`edtui`](https://github.com/preiter93/edtui)
modal editing (Normal/Insert/Visual: `hjkl`, `w`/`b`/`e`, `dd`/`D`/`ciw`/`x`,
`u`/`Ctrl-r`, visual `v`+`y`/`d`/`p`). From Normal mode `:w` (or `Enter` twice)
saves and `:q` (or `Esc`/`q` twice) cancels — the first press arms the action
and the header shows a confirm hint. `Alt-Enter` (Option+Enter) accepts and
`Alt-Esc` discards directly (no double-press) — Alt is the one modified
`Enter`/`Esc` that reaches the app across terminals, including browser/web
terminals like zellij web. `Tab` cycles the comment type in Normal
mode and inserts `comment_tab_width` spaces (default 4) in Insert mode; `Ctrl-s`
also saves.

## Commands

In command mode,
`Tab` and `Shift-Tab` complete or cycle command names.

`draft` applies to GitHub only. `comment` and `approve` work on GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
`request-changes` works on GitHub and GitLab, but not Bitbucket yet.

## Commit selection / review target selector

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` / `Shift-Tab` | Switch between Local and Pull Requests tabs |
| `j` / `k` | Move selection |
| `Space` | Toggle local commit selection |
| `Enter` | Confirm local commit range, open PR, or load more PRs |
| `/` | Filter currently loaded PR rows locally |
| `r` | In Pull Requests tab, toggle all open PRs / PRs requesting your review |
| `q` / `Esc` | Quit / return |

## Inline commit selector

Shown at the top of the diff when reviewing multiple commits. Focus it with `<leader>k` or `Tab`.
When opening a GitHub PR or GitLab MR you have reviewed before, tuicr may preselect only commits
newer than your latest submitted review; commits already covered by that review are marked with
`✓`. Use `Space` / `Enter` here to expand or adjust the range. Bitbucket does not record which
commit an approval covered, so no commits are preselected there.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `k` | Navigate commits |
| `Space` / `Enter` | Toggle commit selection (updates diff) |
| `(` / `)` | Cycle through individual commits |
| `Esc` | Return focus to diff |

## Grouping feedback prompt

Opened by the first `:w` or `:send` of a grouped review, and by
`:grouping feedback` on demand. The verdict is required; the tags and the note
are not.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` / `Shift-Tab` | Move between the verdict, the tags and the note |
| `1` / `2` / `3` (verdict) | Useful / mixed / useless |
| `h` / `l`, `←` / `→` (verdict) | Move the verdict along the three points |
| `j` / `k`, `↓` / `↑` (tags) | Move the tag cursor |
| `Space` (tags) | Toggle the tag under the cursor |
| `Ctrl-W` (note) | Delete the word before the cursor |
| `Enter` | Submit |
| `Esc` | Skip, and stay silent for the rest of the session |

## Confirm dialogs

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `y` / `Enter` | Yes |
| `n` / `Esc` | No |

## Mouse

Mouse support is on by default. Disable with `mouse = false` in config.

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Wheel up / down | Scroll the panel under the cursor (file list, comment navigator, diff, commit list, or help popup) without moving the cursor line |
| Click on a file | Jump to that file (lazygit-style) |
| Click on a directory or group row | Expand or collapse it |
| Click on a diff line | Position the cursor on that line |
| Click on a commit | Toggle selection (or expand the row to load more) |
| Drag in diff | Highlight a range; press `y` to copy the selected source lines |

For full native terminal selection across the UI, hold your terminal's bypass modifier while dragging (usually **Shift** or **Option/Alt**, depending on the terminal).
