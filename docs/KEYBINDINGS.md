# Keybindings

Full reference. Press `?` inside tuicr for an in-app version of this list.

`<leader>` defaults to `;`. Override it with `leader = ","` in `~/.config/tuicr/config.toml`.

## Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `↓` | Scroll down |
| `k` / `↑` | Scroll up |
| `h` / `←` | Scroll left |
| `l` / `→` | Scroll right |
| `Ctrl-d` / `Ctrl-u` | Half page down / up |
| `Ctrl-f` / `Ctrl-b` | Full page down / up |
| `g` / `G` | Go to first / last file |
| `{N}G` | Go to source line N in current file |
| `{N}{motion}` | Vim-style count prefix — repeats `j` / `k` / `h` / `l` / `{` / `}` / `[` / `]` `N` times |
| `{` / `}` | Jump to previous / next file |
| `[` / `]` | Jump to previous / next hunk |
| `m` / `M` | Jump to next / previous comment |
| `/` | Search within diff (case-insensitive); matches on diff content are highlighted and the status bar shows the `[current/total]` position (headers, comments, and PR info are searchable but not highlighted) |
| `n` / `N` | Next / previous search match (wraps around) |
| `Esc` | Clear search-match highlighting; the pattern is kept so `n` / `N` still work |
| `Enter` | Expand or collapse hidden context between hunks |
| `zt` | Scroll cursor to top of screen |
| `zz` | Center cursor on screen |
| `zb` | Scroll cursor to bottom of screen |

## Help

Press `?` to open help.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `/` | Search within help (case-insensitive) |
| `n` / `N` | Next / previous help search match |
| `j` / `k` | Scroll down / up |
| `q` / `?` / `Esc` | Close help |

## File tree

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` | Toggle expand directory (group row while grouping is on) |
| `Enter` | Expand directory or group / jump to file in diff |
| `o` | Expand all directories or groups |
| `O` | Collapse all directories or groups |
| `i` | Filter to files matching a regex (include) |
| `e` | Filter out files matching a regex (exclude) |
| `I` | Clear the include filter |
| `E` | Clear the exclude filter |
| `/` | Search file paths (substring) |
| `n` / `N` | Next / previous file-path match |

These keys are only active while the file tree is focused — in the diff, `i` still
edits the comment at the cursor and `/` still searches the diff.

### Filtering

`i` and `e` take case-insensitive regexes matched against each file's **full
relative path** (`^src/`, `\.rs$`, `test|spec`). Both can be active at once:
include runs first, then exclude removes from what's left.

A filter is not just a tree view — hidden files also disappear from the diff
pane, from `{`/`}` file navigation, `[`/`]` hunk navigation, and from the file
and `+/-` counts in the header. The tree title reports how much is hidden
(`Files · 2/12 · 12 of 58`), and the active patterns show in its bottom border.

Enter applies, `Esc` cancels, `Ctrl-u` clears the line. Reopening a prompt
pre-fills the pattern already applied, so submitting an emptied buffer is the
same as `I` / `E`. An invalid regex reports the error and leaves the prompt open
so it can be fixed. Comments on hidden files are not deleted and still export —
filters are a view, not an edit.

Filters are session-local: they are not written to the review session and reset
when tuicr restarts, but they survive a `:e` reload.

### Hiding reviewed files

`:set noreviewed` / `:set reviewed` / `:set reviewed!` (or the bare `:reviewed`)
hide or show files already marked reviewed with `r`. There is deliberately no
single-key binding: `H` is a vim motion, and this is a command-only feature. Like
`i` / `e`, hidden files leave the tree, the diff pane, `{`/`}` and `[`/`]`
navigation, `/` search, and the `+/-` counts in the header — so the header reports
the diff still left to review.

Two things stay deliberately unaffected. The tree title keeps counting reviewed
files in its `reviewed/total` fraction, since scoping it to the visible rows would
collapse it to `0/n` exactly when progress matters most; the bottom border carries
a `reviewed hidden` cue instead. And a file whose hunks are individually marked
with `R` is not hidden — only the file-level `r` flag counts.

While hiding, `r` becomes a burn-down loop: marking the file you are reading moves
you to the next unreviewed file, wrapping at the end. A hidden file cannot be
un-reviewed, because `r` can no longer reach it — `:set reviewed` brings it back.
Start a session with them hidden via `show_reviewed = false` in `config.toml`.

### Search

`/` moves only the tree selection to the next matching path, expanding collapsed
parents as needed, and leaves the diff viewport where it was — press `Enter` to
jump the diff there. `n` / `N` step matches and wrap around. Search only ever
considers files that pass the active filters.

## Panel focus

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` / `Shift-Tab` | Cycle focus forward / backward between file list, comment navigator, diff, and commit selector |
| `<leader>h` | Move focus one panel left (side-by-side: new side → old side → file list) |
| `<leader>l` | Move focus one panel right (side-by-side: file list → diff → old side → new side) |
| `<leader>k` | Move focus up (comments to files, or diff/files to commit selector when visible) |
| `<leader>j` | Move focus down (files to comments when visible, otherwise diff) |
| `<leader>e` | Toggle file list visibility |
| `<leader>s` | Toggle commit selector visibility (also `:set commits!`) |
| `Enter` | Select file (when file list is focused) |

## Comment navigator

Shown below the file tree when local comments or visible remote PR threads exist.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `k` | Move selection |
| `h` / `l` | Scroll rows left / right |
| `Enter` | Jump to selected comment |

## Review actions

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `r` | Toggle file reviewed |
| `R` | Toggle hunk reviewed |
| `c` | Add line comment (or file comment if not on a diff line) |
| `C` | Add file comment |
| `<leader>c` | Add review comment |
| `v` / `V` | Enter visual mode for range comments |
| `dd` | Delete comment at cursor |
| `i` | Edit comment at cursor (vim: text cursor at start) |
| `A` | Edit comment at cursor with text cursor at end (vim mode only) |
| `e` | Open focused file in `$EDITOR` |
| `y` | Copy review to clipboard |
| `Y` | Copy the comment at cursor to clipboard |

`e` opens the file at the cursor's line. Terminal editors (`vim`, `nvim`, `nano`, …)
take over the screen and tuicr reloads the diff once they exit. Windowed editors
(`code`, `cursor`, `zed`, `subl`, …) open in their own window while tuicr stays on
screen; reload with `:e` after editing. Adding `--wait` to the editor command opts a
windowed editor back into the blocking behaviour. Set the `editor` config key to
override `$EDITOR`.

In PR review `e` opens the revision under review, not whatever the checkout
happens to hold. When the local file *is* that revision you get the real file and
your edits land in it; otherwise — wrong branch checked out, file added or deleted
by the PR, no checkout at all — tuicr writes a read-only copy of the PR's content
to a temp directory and opens that, so the text and the line the cursor sits on
match the diff. The status bar names which one you got, e.g.
`Opened src/main.rs @ 1a2b3c4 (read-only PR copy)`. Binary files are only opened
from the checkout, never copied.

## Visual mode

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `k` | Extend selection down / up |
| `c` / `Enter` | Create comment for selected range |
| `Esc` / `v` / `V` | Cancel selection |

## Comment mode

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` / `Shift-Tab` | Cycle comment type forward / backward (per `comment_types` order) |
| `Enter` / `Ctrl-Enter` / `Ctrl-s` | Save comment |
| `Shift-Enter` / `Ctrl-j` | Insert newline |
| `←` / `→` | Move cursor |
| `Ctrl-w` / `Alt-Backspace` / `Cmd-Backspace` | Delete word |
| `Ctrl-u` | Clear line |
| `Esc` / `Ctrl-c` | Cancel |

With `comment_vim = true` the box uses [`edtui`](https://github.com/preiter93/edtui)
modal editing (Normal/Insert/Visual: `hjkl`, `w`/`b`/`e`, `dd`/`D`/`ciw`/`x`,
`u`/`Ctrl-r`, visual `v`+`y`/`d`/`p`). From Normal mode `:w` (or `Enter` twice)
saves and `:q` (or `Esc`/`q` twice) cancels — the first press arms the action
and the header shows a confirm hint. `Alt-Enter` (Option+Enter) accepts and
`Alt-Esc` discards directly (no double-press) — Alt is the one modified
`Enter`/`Esc` that reaches the app across terminals, including browser/web
terminals like zellij web. `Tab` cycles the comment type in Normal
mode and inserts `comment_tab_width` spaces (default 4) in Insert mode; `Ctrl-s`
also saves.

## Commands

In command mode,
`Tab` and `Shift-Tab` complete or cycle command names.

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `:{N}` | Jump to new-side line N in current file |
| `:o{N}` | Jump to old-side line N in current file (matches deletions) |
| `:w` (`:write`) | Save session |
| `:send` (`:release`) | Release this batch of comments to a polling agent |

| `:submit request-changes` | Submit a Request-changes review |
| `:submit draft` | Submit a Draft (pending) review |
| `:comments unresolved` | Show unresolved remote comments (PR mode, default) |
| `:comments all` | Show all remote comments including resolved and outdated |
| `:comments hide` | Hide remote comments in PR mode |
| `:set wrap` | Enable line wrap in diff view |
| `:set wrap!` (`:wrap`) | Toggle line wrap in diff view |
| `:set relativenumber` / `:set norelativenumber` | Enable / disable relative rendered-row numbers |
| `:set relativenumber!` | Toggle relative rendered-row numbers |
| `:set commits` | Show inline commit selector |
| `:set nocommits` | Hide inline commit selector |
| `:set commits!` | Toggle inline commit selector |
| `:set reviewed` | Show files already marked reviewed |
| `:set noreviewed` | Hide files already marked reviewed |
| `:set reviewed!` / `:reviewed` | Toggle files already marked reviewed |
| `:clear` | Clear all comments |
| `:clearc` | Clear comments without clearing reviewed marks |
| `:help` (`:h`) | Open the help screen |
| `:messages` | Open full details for the current error |
| `:version` | Show tuicr version |
| `:update` | Check for updates |
| `:q` (`:quit`) | Quit (warns on unsaved comments; discards review-only state) |
| `:q!` (`:quit!`) | Force quit |
| `:x` / `:wq` | Save and quit (prompts to copy if comments exist) |
| `ZZ` | Save and quit |
| `ZQ` | Quit without saving |
| `?` | Toggle help |

Pressing bare `q` no longer quits by default; it prints a reminder to use `:q` instead. Set
`q_quits = true` to restore `q` as a quit key in review modes.

The summary replaces the diff while leaving the file sidebar visible when it is open. The first
pending comment is selected when the summary opens. Use `j`/`k` to select the next
or previous comment; the view scrolls automatically to keep the selection visible. `Enter` returns
to the continuous diff and jumps to the selected comment, leaving single-file view if necessary,
while `Esc` returns without jumping. Reviewed files and hunks are revealed for the jump without
losing their reviewed state.

Not every forge supports every event:

| Event | GitHub | GitLab | Gitea | Bitbucket | Azure DevOps | Gerrit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `comment` | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| `approve` | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes (vote +10) | yes (vote +2) |
| `request-changes` | yes | yes | yes | no | yes (vote -10) | yes (vote -1) |
| `draft` | yes | yes | yes | no | yes (plain comment) | yes |

Bitbucket rejects `request-changes` and `draft` up front rather than silently downgrading them.
Azure DevOps has no pending-review primitive, so `draft` posts as a plain comment with no vote.
Gitea requires a review summary for `request-changes` and `draft`, and for `comment` when there
are no inline comments; inline comments alone do not satisfy it. GitLab `draft` creates draft
notes that the author publishes from GitLab's own "Submit review" UI. Gerrit `draft` stores draft
comments that the author publishes from Gerrit's Reply UI.

## Commit selection / review target selector

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` / `Shift-Tab` | Switch between Local, Pull Requests, and Sessions tabs |
| `j` / `k` | Move selection |
| `Space` | Toggle local commit selection |
| `Enter` | Confirm local commit range, open PR, load more PRs, or resume a saved review |
| `/` | Filter currently loaded PR rows locally |
| `r` | In Pull Requests tab, toggle all open PRs / PRs requesting your review |
| `Esc` | Return to the diff |
| `:q` | Quit |

The Sessions tab lists saved reviews for the current checkout, so you can pick one
instead of retyping the commit range it was opened with. Rows show the review target,
comment count, reviewed files, and age. Reviews with no comments and no reviewed files
are omitted. Selecting a saved PR review re-fetches it from the forge, the same as
opening it from the Pull Requests tab.

## Inline commit selector

Shown at the top of the diff when reviewing multiple commits. Focus it with `<leader>k` or `Tab`.
When opening a GitHub PR or GitLab MR you have reviewed before, tuicr may preselect only commits
newer than your latest submitted review; commits already covered by that review are marked with
`✓`. Use `Space` / `Enter` here to expand or adjust the range. Bitbucket does not record which
commit an approval covered, so no commits are preselected there.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `k` | Navigate commits |
| `Space` / `Enter` | Toggle commit selection (updates diff) |
| `(` / `)` | Cycle through individual commits |
| `Esc` | Return focus to diff |

## Confirm dialogs

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `y` / `Enter` | Yes |
| `n` / `Esc` | No |

## Mouse

Mouse support is on by default. Disable with `mouse = false` in config.

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Wheel up / down | Scroll the panel under the cursor (file list, comment navigator, diff, commit list, or help popup) without moving the cursor line |
| Click on a file | Jump to that file (lazygit-style) |
| Click on a directory or group row | Expand or collapse it |
| Click on a diff line | Position the cursor on that line |
| Click on a commit | Toggle selection (or expand the row to load more) |
| Drag in diff | Highlight a range; press `y` to copy the selected source lines |

For full native terminal selection across the UI, hold your terminal's bypass modifier while dragging (usually **Shift** or **Option/Alt**, depending on the terminal).
